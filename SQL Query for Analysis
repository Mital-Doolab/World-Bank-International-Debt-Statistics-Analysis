-- From the preview of the data we can see that each country has different debt indicators meaning each country most likely will have multiple records with more than one debt indicator. We want to find out how many unique countries there are in our dataset before we start performing our statistical analysis. We will use the COUNT function to count the number of countries and use the DISTINCT function to eliminate counting duplicates.
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT country_name) AS distinct_countries_total

-- Now that we know that the total amount of debt is over 3 million USD, let’s determine the top 10 countries with the highest total international debt. This will help us understand more about the country and its socio-economic scenarios. We will use the SUM function to total the debts and then GROUP BY country_name. The result will share the total debt of all debt indicators. We will only output the top 10 countries with the highest total international debt. After running our query we will import our data table as a CSV file and then use Tableau to create a data visualization to better understand the data.

-- In our last query, we learned that China has the highest total international debt. Next, let’s analyze our data to determine what is the average debt across the debt indicators.

-- From our above analysis we learn that the debt indicator “DT.AMT.DLXF.CD” has the highest average debt. This code is for the category that includes payment of long term debts. In other words, to get immediate capital, countries take on long-term debt.

-- Finally, let’s analyze our data to determine the amount of the maximum debt indicator of each country and order the results in descending order. NOTE: This query will calculate the maximum debt across all debt indicators per country not total debt per country which was analyzed earlier.
